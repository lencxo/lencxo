# 👋 Hey there! I'm Lency

I'm a **Computer Science student** with a passion for building both software and technical infrastructure. I bridge the gap between **software engineering** and **IT operations** — developing clean, user-focused applications while also understanding the backend systems they run on. Through coursework and hands-on experience, I've built skills in **systems programming**, **mobile development**, and **Linux system administration**.
